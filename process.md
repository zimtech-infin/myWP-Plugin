#### Step-by-step guide on setting up a PHP development environment, installing Composer, setting up PHPUnit for testing, and developing a custom WordPress plugin.

- [x] Step 1. Setting Up a PHP Development Environment 

     - [x]  1.1 Install PHP

     - [ ]  1.2 Verify the installation

To set up a PHP development environment, follow these steps:

1.1 Install PHP:
    - Download the latest version of PHP from the official PHP website.
    - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
    - Make sure to add PHP to your system's PATH environment variable.

1.2 Verify the installation:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Run the command `php -v` to check if PHP is installed correctly.
    - You should see the PHP version information printed on the screen.

- [ ] Step 2. Setting Up a virtual environment

    /**
     * Installation Steps
     * 
     * 1. Install VirtualBox:
     *    - Visit the VirtualBox website (https://www.virtualbox.org/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
     *    - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
     * 
     * 2. Install Vagrant:
     *    - Visit the Vagrant website (https://www.vagrantup.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
     *    - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
     * 
     * 3. Configure VirtualBox and Vagrant:
     *    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
     *    - Navigate to the directory where you want to set up your virtual environment.
     *    - Run the following command to initialize a new Vagrant environment:
     *      ```
     *      vagrant init
     *      ```
     *    - Edit the Vagrantfile that was created in the previous step to configure your virtual environment.
     * 
     * 4. Start the Virtual Machine:
     *    - Run the following command to start the virtual machine:
     *      ```
     *      vagrant up
     *      ```
     *    - Vagrant will download the base box (if necessary) and start the virtual machine.
     * 
     * 5. Access the Virtual Machine:
     *    - Run the following command to access the virtual machine via SSH:
     *      ```
     *      vagrant ssh
     *      ```
     *    - You can now interact with the virtual machine and perform any necessary tasks.
     * 
     * That's it! You have successfully installed VirtualBox and Vagrant and set up your virtual environment.
